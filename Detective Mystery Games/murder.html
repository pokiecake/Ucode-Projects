          <h2>Hello Detective!</h2>
          <p>It is hard to remember the steps to successfully interrogate a person. However, with these steps, you will find it easy to get the truth.</p>
          <h3>Interrogation</h3>
          <p>All you gotta do to talk to people is to click on them. Although remember that you can't interrogate at all times. Wait for people to finish talking and wait until your interrogation starts.</p>
          <h3>Evidence</h3>
          <p>To interrogate about evidence, click on a piece of evidence before talking to people. You'll know you selected a piece of evidence if it is highlighted.</p>
          <p>Whenever you interrogate using evidence, a piece of evidence might be levelled up. However, know that not all interrogations with evidence will level up another evidence.</p>
          <p>If a piece of evidence is levelled up, you can double click on it to review precious levels. (Again, like interrogation, you have to wait until people stop talking.)</p>
          <h3>Accusing</h3>
          <p>You can only accuse someone once every piece of evidence is levelled up. Once you decide to accuse someone, you can't go back to interrogate somone again.</p>
