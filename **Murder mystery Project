            <li>This game is purely point and click.</li>
            <li>When you progress, you will gather more clues.</li>
            <li>When you interrogate someone, you can interrogate them about the clues you have.</li>
            <li>Not everything important will be written in the clues. Read the suspect's testimony carefully.</li>
            <li>Red text is the detective (you) speaking.</li>
            <li>You can only guess who the killer is once you gathered all the clues.</li>
            <li>If you get the killer wrong, you can still go back and guess again.</li>
            <li><strong>It is important to not go into the source code.</strong>
            This will reveal the parts of the story. It's fine to dig into the source code when you found the killer.
            (If there's something wrong with the javascript, then tell me and I will find out in the console.)</li>
            <li>Because I'm bad at thinking of names, there will be no true name for each person (even the victim).</li>

        <p>You enter a party that has had a noise complaint
        and used illegal fireworks. When you walk in, you see a body along
        with 5 people surrounding it. You and some other cops at the scene
        order everyone to line up against the wall. You begin to investigate
        the scene.</p>

        furniture everywhere. The place would seem well kept if it weren't for
        the clothes. Decorations litter the walls and floors. There is some food
        and plates on the kitchen table along with beer and a small case of vodka.
        Outside there are some dust and shrapnel presumably from fireworks.
        The body has burn marks on it.</p>
