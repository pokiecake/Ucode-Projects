        <h2>What it is</h2>
        <p>Not to be confused with club penguin Island, this is a 
        game where you can hang out with other penguins and have 
        fun with games or parties.  If you're new, you can have a 
        tour of the place to better understand it.  This page will 
        talk about the features generally.</p>

        <p>There are a bunch of games that you are able to play in CPR.  You can earn 

coins in all of the games.  With the coins, you can buy clothing, items,

furniture, etc.  Plus, you can socialize with other penguins and assemble

a group to do something like play a band or play a hockey team.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of rooms in CPR.  Some rooms are only accessible during 

events.  You will find a different environment in all of them, and you 

might remember the names of all of the rooms.  You can find mini-games, party rooms, 

and pins.  Pins are scattered everywhere and expire at some 

date.  You can put pins on your player cards.  Pins are usually found 

in rooms, hidden.  </p>

        <p>Coins are the currency in the game.  You earn coins by entering a code, 

mining, or playing mini-games.  Once you earn your coins, you can spend 

them in various ways.  You can buy clothing, furniture, or backgrounds.

You will probably want or need items so you have to earn your coins to get it. 
You will most likely get them from mini-games.</p>
