          <p>Rooms are the places in CPR that you can go in. Some rooms are party
exclusive while others are permanent. Some rooms are changed for a 
party. There are some rooms that need to be unlocked like the hidden
lake or EPF command room. Rooms have their own quirks like mining, 
throwing snowballs, shopping, and all kinds of stuff.</p>

        <p>Pins are collectible items in CPR.  The pins are usually released
during special events, but sometimes they aren't.  Once you find them, 
you can put them on your player card.  Remember that a pin eventually will
be gone, and you will never be able to obtain the pin again.

            <img src="https://goo.gl/sR5njg">
            <p>Puffles are these pets that roam around in CPR.  You can adopt them in
the pet shop for about 400 coins.  Once you adopt puffles, you can care
for them in your igloo.  You can also buy furniture that cares for your 
puffle for you, cleaning, sleeping, or amusement.  You can also take your
puffle out for a walk, but they will deny if they are in a bad mood.  
The puffles have special dances, and you can bring certain puffles to 
certain games and the puffles will grant you special bonuses during the game.</p>

            <h2>Codes</h2>
            <img src="https://goo.gl/wVBoUW">
          <p>Codes are not figured out in CPR.  Instead, they are released
on a social media platform like Twitter.  You can enter codes in
unlock items online, shown in the picture.  After you enter a code, you
will get coins and/or clothing.</p>

              </div>
            <p>The EPF and PSA are secret organizations.  The EPF is the Elite Penguin
Force that is found by passing a test by getting an invitation from a 
penguin or from finding a secret in a book.  The PSA is the Penguin 
Secret Agency that is the sister organization to the EPF.  You get an 
invitation by finding a secret to the moderator rules.  They both have a 
job of keeping the island safe.  You can do missions and field ops to 
gather medals to buy some clothes.</p>
