<h1>Don't Starve Together</h1>

  <p>My favorite game is Don't Starve Together (DST) because it features <strong>hard</strong> challenges and enemies, it features <em>wonderous</em> characters, and you are able to play with your friends.  If you want more information, click <a href="https://goo.gl/BxtJY2">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-play">How to Play</h2>

  <p>DST is a survival game with 3 main stats to worry about,<strong> health</strong>, <strong >hunger</strong>, and <strong > sanity</strong>. Also, you have to build a <strong >base</strong>, and get ready to attack monsters like the
  <a href="https://goo.gl/c6PjyM">hounds</a> or <a href="https://goo.gl/x6vpsW">treeguards</a></p>

<h3 id="Hunger">Hunger</h3>

  <p><strong>Hunger</strong> will increase depending on the food you eat. When the <strong>hunger</strong> stat reaches 0, <strong>your health will start to slowly deplete.</strong> Every characters' <strong>hunger</strong> depletes at the same time, except <a href="https://goo.gl/24KQNU">Wolfgang.</a></p>

<h3 id="Health">Health</h3>

  <p>So <strong>health</strong> tells how much damage the player can take. When it reaches 0, you die and turn into a ghost. In order to be alive again, <strong>another player</strong> has to revive you with a telltale heart (assuming your playing with others), or you go into a touch stone. Once everyone dies, the world resets (unless one finds an <em>unused</em> touch stone) . You can also sacrifice health to do other tasks.</p>

<h3 id="Sanity">Sanity</h3>

<p><em>Sanity</em> tells how sane your character is. The more your sanity goes down, the more the <em>area</em> changes around you. There might be <strong>eyes</strong> at night, cute bunnies <strong>change their form</strong>, and in <strong>super serious</strong> sanity depletions, you'll see these shadow creatures who attack you. <strong>Either fight them</strong>, or<strong> bring your sanity back up.</strong></p>

<h3 id="Base">Your Base</h3>

  <p><strong>Your base</strong> should have</p>

  <ul>
<li>a food source</li>
<li>a fire place</li>
<li>something to protect against monsters</li>
</ul>

  <p>Be careful, <strong>your base</strong> could be destroyed by <strong style="color: #d8d811">lightning</strong> or giants, <em>rampaged</em> by hounds, or your <strong>farm</strong> could catch a disease or on <strong style="color: #dd5f1c">fire!</strong><br> <br> There are ways to counteract these problems, but you can search it up <a href= "https://goo.gl/BxtJY2">here</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="The-characters">The Characters</h2>

<p>There are many wonderous characters in DST. They have their positives, while having some negatives as well</p>

<h3><a href="https://goo.gl/FD8nwY">Wilson</a></h3>

<img src="https://goo.gl/kZbDzR">

<p>Wilson, the gentleman scientist, is a basic character. He grows a <strong>beard</strong> and has no <strong>negatives</strong>. Although, this means he doesn't have anything else that helps him get through the game</p>

    <h3> <a href="https://goo.gl/p5DcxN">Wx-78</a></h3>

<img src="https://goo.gl/NqQ8Zc">

  <p>Wx-78 is a robot who has <strong>no</strong> feelings and is <strong>not</strong> a <strong style="green">picky eater</strong>. He gets damaged by <strong style="color:aqua"> water</strong>, but gets <strong>powerful</strong> when <em>struck</em> by <strong style="color: yellow">lightning</strong>. You can use <strong>gears</strong> to make him more powerful as well.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://goo.gl/n8eRc4">Webber</a></h3>

  <img src="https://goo.gl/wB3NWN">

  <p>Webber is a <strong>spider-human monster</strong> that can eat <strong>monster meat</strong> (usually harmful to other characters), grow a <strong style="color:white">silk</strong> beard, and can <strong>befriend spiders</strong>. However, <strong style="color: #f76881">pigs</strong> and <strong style="color:white">bunny men</strong> will <strong>attack</strong> him, and he only has <strong>100</strong> maxium <strong>sanity</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="DST">Things I've Done in DST</h2>

  <p>I've been able to hold up my base as WX-78 until the of winter, until a giant (<a href="https://goo.gl/sZq82Q">Deerclops</a>) was able to destroy my base and killed me in the process. About the most productive thing I did is building the crockpot and prehastitator. There really isn't much to do in DST until you explore a lot or go in the caves, which I haven't gotten to yet</p>

<p>This is the Giant that killed me.

<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So in conclusion, DST is a great game to play with others, especially with free time. Be aware though, it does cost $15 dollars on Steam, so save up your allowance! (although you probably have $15 already) </p>
