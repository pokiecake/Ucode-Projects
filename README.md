# Ucode-Projects
These are coding projects I created when I was in middle school. 

These range from websites about games I was interested in to games I made myself, although most are likely buggy.

Some of these are also just unfinished ideas I never got around to.

If you look really closely at the code, you might find some "interesting" coding decisions I made. 

In my opinion, I think the Club Penguin Rewritten Website and The Maze Project are the best projects I made (at least, relative to the other projects). Due note that the CPR project was made using images from other websites instead of downloaded jpgs, so most of them are gone.
