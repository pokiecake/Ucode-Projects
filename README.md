# Ucode-Projects
These are coding projects I created when I was in middle school. 

These range from websites about games I was interested in to games I made myself, although most are likely buggy.

Some of these are also just unfinished ideas I never got around to.

If you look really closely at the code, you might find some "interesting" coding decisions I made. 

Some of the websites used image links directly from the internet, so some of the images are broken.

Projects I think are worth visiting:
Club Penguin Rewritten V.3 (although the images are broken)
The Maze Project
Chess (which includes Checkers and tic-tac-toe)
Detective Mystery Games

Please do not visit **Murder Mystery Project.** That is a result of extremely poor code design.
