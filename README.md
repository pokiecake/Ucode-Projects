# Ucode-Projects
These are coding projects I created when I was in middle school. 

These range from websites about games I was interested in to games I made myself, although most are likely buggy.

Some of these are also just unfinished ideas I never got around to.

If you look really closely at the code, you might find some "interesting" coding decisions I made.
