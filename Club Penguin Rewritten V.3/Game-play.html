        <p>A lot of games are scattered everywhere around the island, and it isn't 
a secret.  When you play the games, you will earn coins once you are done.
With coins, you can buy various items like clothing or furniture.
All of the games are fun and some are challenging in their own way.
Try to find the game above. (It is probably <em>the best game</em>
for coins.)</p>

      <p>Stamps are earned when you do something special.  For mascots, you 
have to meet them online.  You can't meet them as an NPC and get stamps. For everything else, just do what it says although parties are in a limited time.  If you earn all of the stamps in a game, you will earn
double coins when you finish a game.  So if you get 1000 coins, 
you will earn 2000 coins.  This is great when playing aqua grabber, 
the secret game, since you earn a lot of coins from that game.  
Anyways, it is fun to get stamps and you can decorate your stamp book 
with the stamps you get.</p>

        <h2>Activities</h2>
        <img src="https://goo.gl/jnw68t">
        <p>On the island, you will find other penguins walking around.  Those are
real people who are logged in and want some fun as well.  You can
socialize and assemble bands and groups.  You can dress up and do 
other activities like drilling or roleplaying.  You can dance or get 
activity stamps.  You can also invite penguins to your igloo or get invited
to an igloo.  After you're in an igloo, you can set up a party.  There are 
many activities to do in Club Penguin Rewritten.

      <h2>Coins</h2>
      <img src="https://goo.gl/q2hHBC" id="money">
      <p>Coins are the currency of the game. You can get a lot of items from coins.
Furniture, clothing, puffles, they all need coins in order to get. 
It's easy to get coins. One way to get coins is by playing games. Aqua Grabber
and mine surfer are probably the best games to rack up coins. Aqua Grabber
is kind of slow but generates an enormous amount of coins, shown on the table,
While mine surfer doesn't generate as much, but it can be played a lot 
more times than aqua grabber. Mining is another way but it doesn't seem 
fun since you're just mining in one spot repeatedly. Finally, you can 
enter codes to get coins, but that takes too long since codes 
aren't released that often, so you shouldn't depend on codes to get 
coins. Decorate your penguin or igloo with the coins you get.</p>

      <p>*The min and max coins for a completed game.<br>
      **May need more calculation.</p>
      <p>This is a table showing the name, stamps, levels, and minimum and
      maximum coins for 6 games.  This table can help you decide what games
      you should play for coins, how long a game would take, or how much
      stamps you can earn.  However, the infinite coins means that the game
      doesn't stop automatically, but it doesn't mean that it is fast or easy.
      If you have all of the stamps for the games, you will get double the amount
      of coins.</p>
