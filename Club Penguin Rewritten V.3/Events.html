      <p>Depending on the time, you might wonder what is going on.  In CPR, there are
different parties going on that are relevant today or just for
fun. Whenever an item appears in a party, <strong>it might disappear when the
party ends</strong>, so it is kinda important.</p>

      <h2>nd Mascots</h2>
      <img src="https://goo.gl/Upt8Ja">
      
      <p>Mascots are characters in CPR that have appeared somewhere.  
      For example, Aunt Arctic is the editor and publisher of the newspaper, Rockhopper who is a pirate, 
      Sensei who built the dojo, and a lot of other characters.  
      When they are online, <strong>you have to meet them on the same server in the 
      same room to get a stamp.</strong></p>

      <p>There might be other events or groups in CPR, one famously called the rebel
Penguin Federation.  They might be doing groups, Olympics, etc.

Also, they have a mascot tracker to tell you when a mascot is online.

If you don't really like that, there might be groups or tours at random times.  
If you see a band in the lighthouse, you can join the band for fun.</p>

        <h2>The Newspaper</h2>
        <img src="https://goo.gl/5h5m7n">
        <p>The newspaper is accessible from the top left of your computer screen. 
<em>It tells events and can refer to parties or mascots</em>.  The writer and publisher of the newspaper
is Aunt Arctic.  You can send her your 
question, joke, poem, or misc. and she might put it in the newspaper.  If 
you get featured in the newspaper, you will get a rare item called a blue book.  
You can learn interesting things about the island and can find out whether or not there
is a new pin.
