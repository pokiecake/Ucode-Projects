      <h1>Origins of 666</h1>
      <p>666 originated in the Bible and relates to "the beast."  Many have
      related this number to real life happenings or symbols.  So is the 
      devil, Lucifer, taking control of the world?  Some are pretty 
      convincing, others not so much.  Although you will have to understand
      the number before you can debunk or prove it.</p>
