      <banner>Note: These strategies won't get you to win
      every game. These are strategies are mainly from expierence
      and the <a href="https://bit.ly/ZM2Ooq">Town of Salem Wikia.</a>
      Coven roles are omitted from this page as I don't have the Coven DLC.</banner>

    <h3>Town</h3>
    <p>Town has to kill any evildoers*. They have to use their various
    abilities to find and kill evildoers. They have to watch out for jesters,
    as jesters are more of a threat to town than any other role. A survivor may also
    betray them in the future.
    </p>
    <p>Anyone who is too quiet might be evil and should require visits by
    the Jailor or investigative roles to make sure they aren't evil. Unless the jester
    will harm the town, you shouldn't execute them as a jailor since it will waste
    an execution. A vigilante would be more appropiate. The role that can figure out
    the Mafia and Coven roles is the Spy. The spy sees who the Mafia and/or Coven
    visit. If there aren't many visits (apart from killing visits), then the Mafia
    likely has forger and janitor (this is also supported more if the spy sees 2
    visits to the same dead person). If there are 2 or 3 visits every day, then it might
    have Consigliere, Consort, Framer, or other roles. (If a person claims roleblocked
    and a Mafia member visited them, there is most likely a consort.) The Jailor can
    also jail and demand a claim from anyone. The Jailor can deal 3 unstoppable attacks
    to 3 targets. Anyone who is too quiet or doesn't respond right away may be evil.

      <h3>Mafia</h3>
      <p>The Mafia has to kill anyone who doesn't submit to the mafia*.
      They use their abilities to kill and deceive the town as well as other roles.
      Only the Godfather and Mafioso chooses who to kill, and the mafioso has to 
      kill whoever the Godfather chooses unless the Godfather is unavaliable. All
      Mafia roles should think of roles to fake-claim. Consigliere's and Consorts can
      easily claim Investigator and Escort respectivly. The biggest threat to Mafia
      is the spy, as the spy can see whoever the Mafia visits. This means that the 
      spy will see who the Consigliere and Consort visit, meaning that they can use
      the Mafia visits to say that the Consigliere and Consort are guilty. Blackmailer
      can see whispers and prevent a person from talking. Blackmailer and Consigliere
      should report any info to the Mafia chat, as they can't communicate to the Mafia
      when they are dead. The biggest threat to Mafia are Neutral Killings since the Mafia
      can't kill Neutral Killings. Even if they find the neutral Killing, they shouldn't
      out them right away, as the Neutral Killing can kill people the Mafia don't have
      to.</p>

      <h3>Neutral Killing</h3>
      <p>Neutral Killing roles have to kill anyone who opposes them*. They are the
      lone wolves. The serial killer can kill every night, but are generally weak.
      A sheriff is also able to find a serial killer. The werewolf can kill during Full
      moons and will kill their target and anyone who visits their target. They can
      only be found by a sheriff on full moon nights. Also, if the serial killer and
      a werewolf on a full moon night is jailed and not executed, they will kill the jailor.
      The arsonist kills people slowly, but has the highest attack. They douse people
      each night, and can choose to kill everyone they douse by igniting them.
      They should kill active players, as the less active players could be evils or
      neutrals that can help them. In Normal Games, they will be the only neutral killing.
      This means that they won't have to watch for other Neutral Killings and vampires.
      Arsonist can technically claim any role, as dousing someone will change their
      investigative results. So the Arsonist can claim doused. The werewolf should target
      people who claim TP (make sure there's no bodyguard, or else the werewolf will
      die) to leave the town vulnerable. They can also kill quiet people, as TI's
      might target them. The serial killer should kill active people, as they can be
      people who will find the serial killer.</p>

        <h3>Neutral Evil</h3>
        <p>Jesters should be suspicious, but not too suspicious. Being quiet may
        work, but you might get a visit from the jailor or get shot by a vigilante
        instead. When they are dead, it might be a good idea to claim and try to mislead
        the town. Claiming a role, and providing wrong information can work, especially
        if the town goes along with you. Acting too suspicious will make people believe
        that you are a jester. Executioners can follow a similar strategy by claiming
        a role and putting suspicioun on their target. The witch has to find the Mafia
        or Neutral Killing. They also have to find the Town roles, especially jailor,
        so they know what they can fake-claim and to use the correct abilities on
        the Town or Evils.</p>

        <h3>
        Neutral Benign
        </h3>
        <p>The survivor, while winning with every role, isn't easy to 
        win with. The Town will distrust survivors if they don't contribute with
        finding evils. The Mafia and Neutral Killings might want to kill the Survivors
        since they can turn on them and lynch then. Survivor is also a claim that
        evils fake-claim, putting more distrust on Survivors. Survivors should side with
        the faction that will win. This will mean that the faction they side with won't
        kill them, although you can also betray them and should betray if they turn
        into the losing faction. The Amnesiac is similar to Survivor, as it should
        remember the role that is winning. It can also remember early and take sides.
        The disadvantage is that you can't claim Amnesiac anymore. The Guardian Angel
        has to predict wether or not their target will get attacked. They can win as
        a survivor, but it will be harder than a regular survivor as they don't have
        any vests.</p>

        <h3>
        Neutral Chaos
        </h3>
        <p>Vampires have to choose who to convert. They have to watch out for Vampire
        hunters, as they are the only role who can find vampires. The vampire hunter can
        hear vampire chat, so the vampires shouldn't type the way they would type 
        during the day. Otherwise, the Vampire hunter can link up the vampires' typing
        to a person's typing during the day. When the vampires have 4 members, they
        can deal a basic attack to someone. They should probably kill the same people
        a serial killer would kill, active people and investigatives. The pirate has
        to choose carefully who to duel, although that part isn't too important. The
        longer the game lasts, the better the chance they can get 2 plunders. Go
        to <a href="Roles.html">the roles page</a> to learn its mechanics. The
        common tracker claim for Plaguebearer is tracker, since the Plaguebearer
        knows who is infected. If an infected player visits another player, they will
        become infected. This is the main reason why plaguebearers claim tracker.
        When they become pestilence, they are top priority. They should become Pestilence
        when there are few players left alive. Tracker claims will be more sus if they
        aren't confirmed. People won't be likely to visit, so you can only kill one
        person per night. You should be talkative and provide the Town with leads on
        who could be Pestilence.</p>

        <h3>Goals*</h3>
        <p>Every role has a goal. The town has to kill evildoers, who
        are the Mafia, Neutral Killing, Neutral Chaos except Pirate, and Coven.
        The Mafia has to kill anyone who doesn't submit to the 
        Mafia, who are the Town, Neutal Killing, Neutral Chaos except Pirate, and coven.
        Each Neutral Killing wins with the same Neutral Killing role, Neutral Benign,
        Neutral Evil, and pirate. The jester has to get lynched, the executioner has
        to lynch their target, the witch has to survive and kill the town, the survivor
        wins with everybody, the Amnesiac has to remember a role and win with their
        goal, and the Guardian Angel wins when their target survives until
        the end of the game. The vampire has to kill the Town, Mafia, Neutral Killing,
        Plaguebearer/Pestilence, and Coven. The plaguebearer only wins with Neutral
        Benign, Neutral Evil, and Pirate. Go to the <a href="Roles.html">Roles page</a> 
        for more information.</p>
