      <h4>Day and Night cycles</h4>
      <p>In ToS, the game cycles to day and night.  
      During the day, talk with the other townspeople to
      find out who the evil doers are.  Anyone can make
      accusations against other players, and you are 
      able to vote on who you think is guilty.  You are
      also to claim your role during the day, but some 
      people, especially evildoers, will lie about their
      role to try to not look guilty.  During the night,
      you are able to use your role's ability, though 
      some people have day abilities, and some people 
      have day and night abilities.  The abilities range
      from being able to kill someone, to finding out 
      whether or not someone is evil, or even jailing 
      someone and being able to execute them.  All of 
      the role's abilities are unique, and it will be 
      a fun experience playing ToS.</p>

      <h4>Last Wills</h4>
      <p>All of the roles have last wills.  Last wills 
      allow you to write your notes.  If you are an 
      investigative role, you can write your findings 
      down.  However, if you are evil, then you will 
      have to think of a fake claim to fool the town.  
      If you are suspicious, people will usually ask you
      to copy and paste a will.  Your last will will be
      visible to everyone when you die, with a few 
      exceptions.</p>

      <h4>Death</h4>
      <p>Death can happen in many ways.  From being shot
      by the mafia to suicide, there are a lot of ways 
      to die.  Whenever someone dies, their last will is
      shown.  They also enter the death chat, which is 
      this chat where they can talk to the other dead 
      people, and can see the day chat and night chats 
      if they have one.  No one can see the death chats 
      apart from the medium and anyone who they seance.
      The only way to get alive again is to be a town 
      role and have the Retributionist revive you.</p>

      <h4>Voting and Treason</h4>
      <p>During the day phase, there is also a phase 
      called the Discussion and Voting phase.  The 
      discussion phase allows you to talk with everyone
      and talk about findings and who they think is evil.
      The Voting phase is when people vote for the 
      person they think is evil.  In order to get on the
      stand, they must have enough votes, which is half
      the number of players plus one.  After the player
      gets on the stand, they have some time to defend 
      themselves.  Then everyone excluding the player 
      and the dead vote guilty, innocent, or abstain.  
      If there is a majority innocent votes, or if 
      there's a tie, the player gets pardoned off the 
      stand and people enter the voting phase again 
      (There is a maximum of three pardonings, then the
      town enters the night phase).  If there is a 
      majority of guilty votes, then the player gets 
      executed, with 5 seconds to say their last words.
      Then their will is shown, then their role is 
      revealed.  After that the town enters the night 
      phase or the game ends if everyone's goal is the 
      same.</p>

        <h4>Game modes - Normal</h4>
        <p>There are many game modes in Town of Salem. Each gamemodes are
        divided into sections. The first section is the Normal section, holding
        the Classic, Ranked Practice, and Ranked game modes. Classic is the first 
        classic game modes New people can play. This holds less random roles, generally
        for new players to learn the basics of ToS. The Ranked practice game mode is
        unlocked when new players play 10 game modes of ToS. This game mode is also
        played by ranked players. Ranked is unlocked by playing 50 games of ToS, 10 of
        them being Ranked practice. Ranked and Ranked practice has the same role list,
        but ranked practice, like the name, is to practice for Ranked. When you play Ranked,
        you won't know who you are up against at all, and no scrolls will be used. 
        Ranked is also different than Ranked practice because Ranked allows the players
        to play in seasons. Basically, you are able to gain or lose elo when playing
        Ranked, unless it is your first 10 games in Ranked. The more elo you get, the more
        expierence players you will play against. Once the Seasons of ranked are over, your
        elo is reset, and You will get rewards depending on the number of elo you got.</p>

      <h4>Other Gamemodes</h4>
      <p>The other 2 sections are the Custom and Chaos sections. The Custom gamemodes
      are the Custom and Rapid gamemodes. The Chaos game modes are the All Any, Rainbow,
      and dracula's palace gamemodes. The custom game mode allows the host (the first
      person to join the lobby, or randomly selected if enough people want to repick the
      host) to make up their own role list. It can be anything, and they can start with
      at least 7 people in the lobby. The rapid game mode is like Custom, but the Discussion and
      night phase timer are cut in half. In the chaos section, the All any game mode
      makes the role list Any, meaning anyone can be any role. The rainbow Gamemode
      role list is the Godfather, Arsonist, Survivor, Jailor, Amnesiac, Serial killer,
      Witch, then it goes backward in the first 7 roles (witch, Serial killer, etc.) replacing
      Jailor with Veteran, Godfather with Mafioso, and has the Any role in the middle.
      The roles' color creates a rainbow. Finally, the last game mode is the Dracula's
      palace game mode. It has 4 starting vampires and 1 vampire hunter. The vampires
      are able to kill every night as they have a full team, but can only convert when
      they have 3 or less members. These are the remaining game modes.</p>
