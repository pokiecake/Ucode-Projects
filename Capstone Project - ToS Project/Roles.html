      <h4>Factions</h4>
      <p>There are 2 main factions and another faction 
      lurking around.  The 2 main factions are the town
      and the mafia.  The last faction is the neutral 
      faction who have unique goals to win.  The town 
      has to lynch every evildoer, who are the mafia and
      some of the Neutrals.  The mafia has to kill 
      anyone who does not submit to the mafia, who are 
      the town and some of the Neutrals.  The Neutrals 
      have different goals and abilities than each other.
      Some of them have to kill the town and/or mafia, 
      while some have to survive or have weirder goals.  
      When some neutrals win their goals, the game 
      doesn't need to end, but when the town, mafia, or 
      certain neutrals win the game, the game ends since 
      they killed all of the main factions.  All roles 
      will fit into a faction.</p>

      <h4>Alignments</h4>
      <p>All roles have an alignment, which aren't super
      important to the game.  The Alignment summarizes 
      what your role is about.  The current alignments 
      are Investigative, protective, killing, support, 
      deception, evil, benign, and Chaos.  The town 
      alignments are the first 4 alignments.  Alignments
      go after your faction, so it would be Town 
      Investigative, Town Protective, and so on.  The 
      mafia alignments are the 3rd, 4th, and 5th 
      alignment.  You won't naturally find someone 
      saying those alignments on Town of salem.  The 
      Neutral alignments are the last 3 alignments and 
      killing.  The Neutrals have unique goals depending
      on their alignment.  The benign alignment don't 
      necessarily have to kill to win.  The Neutral evil
      alignment have three roles, the witch, jester, 
      and executioner. They have unique goals to the 
      Neutral faction.  The Neutral killing faction have
      to kill the Town, mafia, and neutrals against 
      their goal.  They are usually the lone wolf, but 
      they can win with the same role.  The Neutral 
      chaos alignment cause chaos to the town with 
      unique abilities.  These are the alignments in 
      ToS.</p>

      <h4>Role List</h4>
      <p>When you start a game, there is a role list.  
      The role list tells you which roles and/or 
      alignments that are in the game.  All of the 
      roles take one spot on the role list.  All game 
      modes have fixed game modes, except custom, which
      allows the host, the first player to join the 
      lobby, to make the role list.  If enough people 
      in the lobby types /repick, the host is randomly 
      picked.  The role list allows people to claim a 
      fake role and for the evils to strategize their 
      kills.  The roles also allow the Town to pick off
      roles when people are confirmed town or once 
      people die, making it harder for evils to claim.</p>

      <h4>The Investigator</h4>
      <p>The investigator has the ability to find at 
      least 3 possible roles that a person can be.  The
      investigation results are fixed, but they can be
      changed by a framer, hex master, or arsonist.  
      This makes it hard to fake-claim if an 
      investigator is in the game.  You shouldn't be 
      too afraid of investigators since there is a 
      chance that there might not be one in game modes
      other than custom and classic.  You need to think
      of roles to fake-claim in case someone asks you 
      to claim a role, or your role won't be possible 
      with the role list.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Rampage - Anyone who visits the house you rampaged will be
        dealt the attack value the role has.</li>
        <li>Attack and Defense - Attack and defense are on a spectrum. If the attack
        is lower on the same place on the spectrum as the target's defense, they will live.
        Otherwise, they will die. Lynching will always kill someone.</li>
        <li>Investigation results - Investigation results will show 3 or more possible
        roles their target can be. Anyone's investigation results will be whatever role
        they are, with some exceptions. If a disguiser disguises as someone, the role they 
        disguised as will be their investigation results. If the investigator's target
        is doused or hexed, their results will be in the Arsonist's and hex master's results
        respectively. Finally, a juggernaut has no investigation result. <br>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Douse - Dousing someone will mean that there is gasoline
        on them. They will not know that they are doused (unless they are an Arsonist).
        Only the arsonist can douse, and if the arsonist ignites, everyone who is doused
        dies (unless they have invinible defense as an arsonist's ignite has an unstoppable
        attack). Dousing will also change their results to Bodyguard, Godfather, Arsonist,
        and Crusader. Gasoline cannot be removed unless an Arsonist does nothing during the night
        and clean the gas off themselves. Gasoline can also be removed by a Guardian
        Angel if they watch over their target.</li>
        <li>Hex - Hexing someone will change their results to framer, jester, vampire,
        hex master. They will also appear as a member of the Coven. No one will
        know that they are hexed. The hex can be removed by a Guardian Angel.</li>
        <li>Astral - This means that the role won't visit the target, but still do
        their ability on them. This means a lookout can't see that target 
        visiting the player, and a tracker can't track them visitng someone. Their
        astral visit can't be intercepted by a bodyguard, veteran, trapper, werewolf, or 
        pestilence.</li>
        <li>Full moon nights - Full moon nights are on even nights, while
        odd nights are non-full moon nights. Even nights are also when the werewolf
        transforms.</li>

        <h4>General Footnotes</h4>
        <p>The Forger, Werewolf, Vampire, Hypnotist, and Necromancer were roles suggested
        by the community. <br> The victory screen that shows up at the end depend on
        how big the faction is. This means that a Survivor win screen would only occur
        when only the survivor wins because of a draw. A pirate wins screen is when only
        pirate wins, etc.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Town Footnotes</h4>
        <p>If a vampire hunter turns into a vigilante, and an Amnesiac
        remembers as vampire, the vigilante will not turn into a vampire. <br>
        A bodyguard will kill anyone who harms their target, also sacrificing their life
        to do so. This means that if a vampire hunter visits a vampire, and a bodyguard
        guards the vampire, the vampire hunter and bodyguard will die as the vampire
        hunter intended to harm the bodyguard's target. It will be obvious that the person
        the vampire hunter visited is vampire, as that is the only way this situation 
        can happen.<br>
        If a psychic survives when there are 2 other players alive, and it is an odd
        night, they will receive the vision,"The Town is too small to accurately 
        find an evildoer." If the psychic is alive when no more Town or Neutral Benign
        is alive, and it is a full moon night, they will receive the vision,
        "The town is too evil to find anyone good!"</p>

          <h4>Mafia Footnotes</h4>
         <p>If there are no mafioso or godfather
         in the mafia, a random mafia member will be promoted to a mafioso.<br>
         When the disguiser dies, their name and role will still be in the mafia chat.
         This is to make sure that the Mafia members don't forget that the disguiser
         has disguised as another role.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Neutral Footnotes</h4>
        <p>Not all neutrals will work together to win, especially if it
        is between two neutral Killings.<br> When Amnesiac remembers a role and wins, it
        is counted as an Amnesiac win.<br> It is possible for a plaguebearer
        victory to occur. This happens when everyone is wiped out and the plaguebearer
        hasn't turned into pestilence. It could also occur when it is a plaguebearer
        with roles that win with Plaguebearer (survivor, Amnesiac, pirate, etc.) 
        and the Plaguebearer hasn't infected them yet.</p>

        <h4>
          Coven Keywords
        </h4>
        <p>Necronomicon - On night 3, the Coven will get the Necronomicon.
        The Coven leader will be the first one to get the necronomicon if they are
        alive. If the person holding the necronomicon dies, it goes to the person
        who join the lobby earlier. The necronomicon gives the role a buff
        to whoever holds it, as well as give that person detection immunity.</p>
