        <h4>Achievements</h4>
        <p>Each role and faction has achievements associated with them.
        Each role has 4 of the same achievements. The achievements
        are winning with that role 1, 5, 10, and 25 times. The rest
        are specific to that role. When you satisfy the conditions of the
        achievement, you get an amount of Merit points depending on
        the achievement. The faction achievements are usually winning with half 
        and all of the roles in the faction. The town faction and Mafia faction also
        have an achievement of having all of the roles in their faction alive.</p>

        <h4>Avatar</h4>
        <p>Your avatar is what you will look like when you enter a game of 
        ToS. The store has skins, houses, pets, death animations, and more for your
        avatar. These items need to be bought by Town points or merit points (Sometimes
        Town points only, sometimes Town points or merit points). You are only able
        to display one of each item, or just have no pet or death animation. Many
        default skins and houses are given to you, but you have to buy/get Pets and
        death animations (the default death animation is the hanging animation).</p>

        <h4>Forums</h4>
        <p>The town of Salem forums are where people can make an account, talk about 
        various subjects, get the updates or news about ToS, and many more things. 
        Signing up as a user on the forums is free. You can see a community and talk
        with the staff members at Blankmediagames. Another thing you can do is post your
        ideas for a new role to put into ToS. You can post your role idea or review 
        others to decide if the role should be in ToS.</p>

        <h4>Victories and draws</h4>
        <p>At the end of the game, there will be a victory or draw.
        A draw happens when there have been no kills in a certain day, 
        everyone has died (with no jester or executioner win), or the remaining 
        players cannot kill another by attack or lynch. With the third condition, 
        the game may give an auto win to prevent draws like that. The win will go to
        the faction with the lowest winrate (Arsonist, Werewolf, Serial Killer, Mafia,
        Town). The stale mate detector also gives the win to the faction that would
        already win in a 1v1 situation. The current victories are the Town, Mafia, 
        Coven, and all neutral roles have their own victory except Amnesiac. Some roles
        can win without their victory message being achieved because one of the bigger
        factions succeeded (roles like the witch, survivor, and jester) There is also
        a Neutrals victory, only possible when a jester and an executioner achieved
        their goal without any other faction winning.</p>
