      <h1>Who is the killer?</h1>
      <p>Instructions: <br>Find out who the killer is by asking everyone at the party. When you ask someone, they will give you some information and along with where they were at the party. Each person has a certain trait, not, has, and killer. If you ask someone with a 'not' personality, they will give you a clue saying that someone does not have this trait. If you ask someone with a 'has' personality, they will give you a trait that the killer has. If you ask the killer, they will pretend to be one of the two traits and give false information.</p>
