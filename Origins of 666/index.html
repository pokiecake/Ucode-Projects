    -What it is
    
    The number 666 is a book inside of the bible.  It is reffered to the 
    mark of the beast, many thinking this is reffering to the devil named 
    Lucifer.

    This mark is popular because of what it means. Some have related this 
    number to real life happening.  Others theroize an end of the world or 
    something like that.
    
    -Real life refrences
    
    Some say that all barcodes have the number 666 because of the black and 
    white marks. This is a guide for to to find out https://goo.gl/Qqaxxm.

    -People who are involved
    
    
    
    -The beast from the sea
    
    
    
    3. Who does this number relate to?
    
    -Why the beast isn't the devil
    First of all, you should know it only says "The mark of the beast" not 
    "The mark of the devil"
    
    -The technique to find the beast
    In order to find the beast, you should know that the name of the beast 
    when the letters are turned into their number counterpart (a=1, z=26, 
    h=8, etc.).  This also proves it isn't the devil since his name is 
    Lucifer, you can do the math on that one
    
    -Why the beast is still unknown
    
    You see, even with the technique, multiple names add up to 666.  
    We can only do speculation after this.
