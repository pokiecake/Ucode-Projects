        <p>If you know what Clappy Trio is, this is basically like a randomized version of this.</p>
        <p>If you don't, then, in this game, there are 3 people, you being one of them. You all need to clap in rhythm with each other. The first person claps, then the second person claps. You use the gap between the first and second to know when you are going to clap.</p>
